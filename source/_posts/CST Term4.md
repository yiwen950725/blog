# This was written in June 2021. I got my diploma yesterday (2021-06-28). Here are some tips for Term 4 (online).
<font size="3">


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CST program has 2 intakes, January and September, also known as winter and fall intakes. In general, high school students come in September. In addition, both Burnaby and Downtown campuses offer CST courses. If you want to learn Python, choose DT. If you want to learn Java, choose BBY. Students are separated into 6 groups, or sets. Four sets (Program Paradigms with Albert, Information Systems with Bruce, Client and Server with Tejinder, Data Communications with D'Arcy) are at BBY, while 2 are at DT. I am with Data Communications BBY.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each set consists of approximately 25 students, and we got to work closely on most of the courses. Teamwork is an important part of BCIT learning. So, one of the most important things is to make new friends among your classmates.</p>

<p><strong>Academic</strong></p>

<p>For this term, we had 2 courses for our option, the data communications. The two courses were taught by our new option head, D'Arcy Smith. Some other courses we had were Business Law, 2 Industry Projects (yes 2 of them!!!!), Operating Systems, and Internet Sturctures (web dev). If you take Information Systems, you don't have BLAW, but there are 3 option courses. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP3800</strong>: This is the first industry project course. So, you get to team up with 3 other students to work for a real company for 4 months. It was really confusing on how you get teamed up, but I got 3 other friends in my option who submitted as the same group then for the same project. Our client was not a tech person so very chill about the final result. very open to any technical stack. We chose React and NodeJS.</p>

<p><strong>COMP 4800</strong>: For this course I decided to team up with 3 of my other friends from different options. Got to do a mobile app for another company, but the CEO was not a tech person either and confused us for the first week. For my intake, this course took place in the last month before graduation, so everyone was not interested in doing anything... </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP 4537</strong>: I enjoyed this web dev course with Amir who seems like the only instructor who was actually teaching in term 4. I felt this course should be taught in term 2. A lot of reviews... if you don't know these by term 4, you will not likely find a job before graduation. </p>

<p><strong>COMP 4735</strong>: Rahim is the nicest guy, but I am not interested in hardware... so not a course for me. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP 3980</strong>: For this course in data comm, we had to do a tic-tac-toe server that handles multiple clients. We used finite state machines. There was no instructions. Very boring. I lost all interests very soon. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP 4985</strong>: This is basically a project course where we used Raspberry Pi to build a voting system for BCIT to use. No instructions given at all so had to go above and beyond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Option-Data Communications</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt super depressed in this option. The reason why that was so was because there was no instructions given on how to do the assignments. There was no feedback, either. I felt like I could have learned everything by watching YouTube videos. Very disappointed. Do not take this option.</p>
