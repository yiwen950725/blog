# This was written in December 2019. Just about to start the second term @ BCIT's CST program. Here are some tips for Term 1.
<font size="3">


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CST program has 2 intakes, January and September, also known as winter and fall intakes. In general, high school students come in September. In addition, both Burnaby and Downtown campuses offer CST courses. If you want to learn Python, choose DT. If you want to learn Java, choose BBY. Students are separated into 6 groups, or sets. Sets ABCD are at BBY, while EF are at DT.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each set consists of 25 students, and we got to work closely on most of the courses. Teamwork is an important part of BCIT learning. So, one of the most important things is to make new friends among your classmates.</p>

<p><strong>Academic</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For first term, we had 7 courses. (It was 6 core courses which were used to calculate GPA.)  These courses are web dev (front and back-end), Java (for BBY), projects, system design/management, applied mathematics, business communications and one CST general info course. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP1100</strong>: general CST info course. In this course hosted by Donna, she would talk about some basic information about how you can be successful in this program. You would write a journal every week to pass the course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP 1930</strong>: this is a projects course. In this course you would be joining other two people in your set and working on a project together. Some of the skills you need is the use of Firebase and JavaScript. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP 1510</strong>: this is the Java course. Our instructor was Bruce Link who is a super wise man. There are four assignments in this course. The last two can be a little hard for people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP 1536</strong>: as far as I know, BCIT has changed the curriculum. So, this course is no longer offered. This is a web development course. Arron would go over both front-end and back-end using Javacript.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP 1113</strong>: applied mathematics course. In this course, a number of topics are covered: K-maps, conversion of numbers between different bases, matrices, 2's complement etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP 1712</strong>: this course is a systems design course, but the instructor we had was very new to teaching so had a hard time following up. In this course, agile development was covered. And we also learned a little bit about database design such as 1st normalization and 2nd normalization.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP 1116</strong>: business communications course it is. I feel like a lot of us had a really hard time in this course, but we have learned a lot. We learned how to write recommendation reports, complaint letters and incident reports. There are also presentations. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Social events</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before I started this program, a lot of colleagues and friends told me that there is no social life for students there. However, we managed to have birthday parties and after-exam parties.</p>
