# This was written in December 2020. Just about to start the fourth term @ BCIT's CST program. Here are some tips for Term 3 (online).
<font size="3">


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CST program has 2 intakes, January and September, also known as winter and fall intakes. In general, high school students come in September. In addition, both Burnaby and Downtown campuses offer CST courses. If you want to learn Python, choose DT. If you want to learn Java, choose BBY. Students are separated into 6 groups, or sets. Four sets (Program Paradigms with Albert, Information Systems with Bruce, Client and Server with Tejinder, Data Communications with D'Arcy) are at BBY, while 2 are at DT. I am with Data Communications BBY.</p>

<p>Each set consists of approximately 25 students, and we got to work closely on most of the courses. Teamwork is an important part of BCIT learning. So, one of the most important things is to make new friends among your classmates.</p>

<p>For this term, I personally had 4 courses. (It was 6 courses for most students.)  These courses are Android dev, C++, Algorithms, mathematics, data communications and one option course. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP3760</strong>: This is an algorithm course. My instructor, Tom Mag, is a very nice instructor who teaches with a casual style. Do expect weekly quizzes and labs. These are very helpful if you want to get good grades. I think this course provides a good foundation to algorithms overall.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP 3717</strong>: I am aware that a lot of people did not get a good grade for the group project which is 20%. My suggestion is that you plan out everything and follow the schedule. But the labs, midterm, assignments and final exam are very chill. Make sure you read the slides. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP 3522</strong>: C++ is my least favorite language overall, so I did not find this course to be as interesting. It has a lot of concepts, and labs are generally "demo" style. The instructor likes to record everything into videos so you can re-watch later. Quizzes from before midterm were also something we had to worry about. However, I am aware that due to the online teaching environment, the midterm and final exams are very practical, but if you'd do it in-person, it would be theories.</p>

<p><strong>COMP 3721</strong>: My instructor was Chi En and he is a very popular instructor (also option head for AI). His course had 4 assignments, weekly quizzes and a final project which is MITM attack. I took the summer part-time version but it is the same thing. I'd highly recommend doing this to reduce the workload.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>COMP 4981</strong>: I am a Data Communications student, so this is my option specific course I had to take. This year we had a new option head who was the option head of web and mobile development. So for this course and this option you will need a lot of C. If you are not good at C, you will not be enjoying this option. For this course, we had to write an HTTP server in C so imagine...</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>MATH 3042</strong>: A lot of people find this course very hard to understand. Apart from the instructor's teaching style, stat concepts are very hard to pick up without practices. Even though I got credits from another institution, I still learned this course with my friends. I found it not good when the instructor did not teach R language...</p>

<p><strong>Option-Data Communications</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had to say that I actually didn't expect to do so much in C because I had been very bad with C... My mindset was that if I can learn something I could not do, that would be great. That was indeed what happened. However, I was so stressed out by the workload of the option specific course for this term. Also, if you are a Linux user, you will be enjoying this option.</p>
