# This was written in August 2020. Just about to start the third term @ BCIT's CST program. Here are some tips for Term 2.
<font size="3">

## For this term we have 6 courses, including Object Oriented programming, database, procedural programming, discrete mathematics, system architecture and business communications 2. 
<p><strong>COMM 2216</strong>: Our teacher was Thorsten. This is an English course which teaches you how to answer non-technical questions during interviews. Before interviews, it is important for you to have a perfect resume. A good resume is the key to gaining an interview. The course teaches you exactly that. In addition, there is a proposal report assignment and an instruction manual assignment. Due to COVID-19, the final presentation for proposal report was made a bonus. The final exam was also canceled. There should have been an instruction manual for final but was made interview questions instead.</P>

<p><strong>COMP 2121</strong>: Our teacher was Goran. This is a discrete mathematics course. It was super hard for most of us. The first part of the course is permutations and combinations. It was similar to the materials we learned in high school (old curriculum). The second part of the course was about algorithm and data structures. The midterm and final exam are very hard, but you do not have to pass the exams to pass the course.</P>

<p><strong>COMP 2510</strong>: Albert taught the course. This course is about C. You learn about data structure, not so much about the syntax itself. People always say that learning C well is really helpful for you to succeed in algorithm.</P>

<p><strong>COMP 2522</strong>: Dennis taught the course. He really likes making games, known as a game god. Most of his assignments are about making games, 3D chess or life game. However he is taking a one-year leave. If he is back, he will head the digital processing option again. Most of his labs are ambiguous so the TA is whom you should go to most of the time.</P>

<p><strong>COMP 2714</strong>: Keith taught the course. We did find his materials too old to follow. You need a Windows computer to complete his assignments, which uses Oracle database. He has 6 assignments in total. For these assignments be really careful in details. He takes marks off for not following his instructions. The first part of the course was syntax of SQL, the second part was the design of database.</P>

<p><strong>COMP 2721</strong>: Rahim taught the course. The first 1/3 of the course was review of mathematics stuff. The latter was about universal buses and circuits and so on. We were aware that the course was different by every teacher. In addition to that, Rahim is a really nice instructor to talk to. </P>

For 2 courses in May, we had to take it with the Term 1 students. You will be randomly put into groups with Term 1 students. The experience did not turn out too good. 

<p><strong>COMP 2537</strong>: This course was a review of the first web dev course we had back in Term 1. The first week was to make a responsive website. The second was to make a form. The third was to add a database to it. The last was about animations. </P>

<p><strong>COMP 2800</strong>: You will get an instructor for this course. It was a nightmare for me. My instructor did not teach me anything in this project. In fact, this course was put in a terrible way. The Term 2 students had to do most of the tasks. Besides that, there is a ton of paperwork to be completed everyday. I worked 15 hours per day to make ends meet. My instructor gave me a bad mark because she thought I did not do anything for my group, given the fact that she has been informed multiple times there were people who did not contribute. The instructors always say it is also a difficult time for them as well, but their actions convinced me that they have always been like this with or without COVID-19.</P>

## PS: If you have a Co-op job, you don't have to take the 2 summer courses. I would suggest doing so. But, if you are from January intake, you should prepare yourself.
